# Help Desk - IT Ticketing Solution

**Help Desk is a tool for IT Departments to manage support tickets.**


## User Stories

###### What can users do?

**Users come to page that prompts them to signup/login as a regular user or an admin** In a real world version of this app, Users would be given a link to an already created account and be prompted to reset their password after first login. For demonstration purposes, anyone can create either type of account.

**Users have a role, such as "Admin" or "User" and have different CRUD operations based on their role.** Admins have full CRUD functionality, while regular users can't delete tickets, only change their status to "Completed".

**Users can create tickets and assign tickets to themselves.** When someone typically calls an IT department, the department inputs a Ticket into the queue and team members are assigned tickets randomly or given tickets by admins

**Users can view a ticket queue and choose tickets to work on.** I've heard horror stories that some ticket queues have thousands of tickets in the queue.
